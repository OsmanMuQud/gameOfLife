# gameOfLife
This code replicates the cellular automata made by John Horton Conway in 1970. 
This has a function make() which receives an array as a parameter and then draws it in the grid when assigned key is pressed.
this can be paused in middle of operation using enter and spacebar.
click can be use to add and subtract cells from the grid.
the grid is mapped in such a way that the cells at the end of the grid are next to the start of the grid.
cells are objects so more than one state can be used to describe the behaviour of an cell.
